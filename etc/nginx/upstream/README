#
# The NGINX configuration creates a load balancing
# pool (upstream) that includes a pool of servers
# identified in this directory by the SERVER_TYPE,
# IP ADDRESS and TCP PORT.
#
# Presumably these IP ADDRESSes are in the 127/8 
# CIDR Range (see RFC3330, Special-Use IPv4 Addresses)
# with the following expectation:
#
#	AUDIT:	127.0.1.0/16
#	BROKER:	127.0.2.0/16
#	CIPHER: 127.0.3.0/16
#	KEYS:	127.0.4.0/16
#
# NOTE: The use of localhost is presumed.  However for
# scaling purposes, there is no restriction on the use
# of non-local IPv4 addressess.
#
# NOTE: IPv6 is not supported at this time.
