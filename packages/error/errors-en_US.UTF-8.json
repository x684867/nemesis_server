	(c) 2013 Sam Caldwell.  All Rights Reserved.
	
	This package creates a centralized error handling mechanism for the framework, including
	error management and error reporting.  Each package consuming this error handler service
	can provide its own localized and package-specific error strings, extending the root.error
	object created by this package so that packages are kept light and free of expensive load
	time binding.
	
	USE:
		root.error
		
	DOCUMENTATION:
